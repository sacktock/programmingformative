    <h1>The Internet</h1>
    <p>At its basics, the Internet is a sprawling system of interconnected computer networks - a <em>network of networks</em>. These networks include private, public and academic, all linked through various technologies such as wireless and optical networking.</p>
  <p>The origins of the Internet can be traced back to the 1960s, when the federal government of the United States commissioned research into a robust, fault-tolerant communication with computer networks (known as ARPANET). It served as a backbone for interconnection of academic and military networks in the 1980s but was decommissioned in 1990. Its replacement was the National Science Foundation Network that served to promote and advance research and education networking in the United States. Through further public funding and private industry partnerships, it quickly developed into a major part of the Internet backbone. </p>
  <p>The Internet has allowed the World Wide Web to thrive, and with it, has connected billions of people. It is therefore no surprise that there are several areas where the Internet has been a medium for positive impact on society. </p>

          <h4>The Internet of Things</h4>
          <div class="col colscroll">
            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the billions of devices connected to the Internet, collecting and sharing data. It generally refers to devices that wouldn't be expected to have an internet connection and can communicate with the network independently of human action (hence why a smartphone would not be considered an IoT device but a smartwatch may).</p>
            <p>It's very easy to see how the IoT can make things better in the home; smart speakers make it easier to play music or get information, home security systems allow easier access to see what is going on inside or outside, and smart thermostats can help heat homes before a user's return. However, it also has applications outside the home, such as aiding in furthuring our understanding of how noisy or polluted our environment is.</p>

          <h4>Internet Activism</h4>
          <div class="col colscroll">
            <p>The Internet has allowed for communication to be practically instant. This enables social activism to be faster and more effective as now particular information can be delivered to large and specific audiences in a short space of time. Many political groups take advantage of this new medium of communication to allow for better coordination. <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/10youth.html">suggested</a> that social media played a key role in the political revolutions in Egypt by helping activists organise protests, discuss grievances, and share information.</p>

          <h4>Philanthropy</h4>
          <div class ="col colscroll">
            <p>The recent spread of low-cost Internet access in developing countries has allowed for new avenues to be explored by peer-to-peer charities. Individuals are able to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals. In 2009, the US-based nonprofit <a href="https://www.zidisha.org/">Zidisha</a> became the first peer-to-peer microlending service to link borrowers and lenders across international borders without the need for an intermediary. This results in a dramatic reduction in cost of microfinance services to the entrepreneurs.</p>
