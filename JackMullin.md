## Interest of content

**Very good**

All pages have interesting content. Medicine and memes are a bit short, but the memes are high quality so that makes up for it.

## Consistency and quality of visual presentation

**Good**

All pages use separate CSS files which means the style of presentation is quite different between pages, but visual presentation is good overall. The navbar includes responsive design for mobile, and the columns automatically collapse themselves on small screens. However, a couple of the pages get messed up on small screens. The Internet has several overlapping elements and bad offsets, and the pictures and videos in AI are not responsive.

## Quality of written presentation

**Excellent**

Spelling and grammar is all good. Minor punctuation issues.

## Validity of HTML

**Excellent**

All blocks are properly closed. There's a paragraph in AI which I think is supposed to be a list; see HTML comment.

## Evidence of collaboration

**Very good**

Some contributors did more than others, but all contributed their own pages including CSS. The author details were all written by someone other than the author. The navbar and footer are consistent between pages.
