Review of the Programming Formative Website:

1. Interest of Content:
Outstanding 8/9 (bonus points for memes)
Content is interesting and concise. Use of pictures and Youtube videos is
good and intuitive, especially enjoyed the world-class memes. Could have
extended the written content of a few sections.

2. Consistency and quality of visual presentation:
Excellent 7/9
Visual presentation relies upon a good style, with a blue top bar.
Consistency could be better, with standard size of headings at the top of
the page and standard position of images.

3. Quality of written presentation:
Very Good 6/9
There could be more paragraphs explaining the topics in more detail
(would have enjoyed a history of memes), but where written content
is provided it is correct and informative.

4. Validity of HTML:
Good 5/9
Used: https://validator.w3.org
No Errors with Memes and Internet, but errors with Medicine and Ai

5. Evidence of Collaboration
Outstanding 8/9
Good amount of commits, with added comments too, with consice, informative
descriptions such as "Added Memes". Good balance of commits among the
authors, and not all done at last minute.
